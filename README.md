# MapLibre route snapper

This plugin lets you draw routes in MapLibre GL that snap to some network (streets, usually). Unlike similar plugins that send a request to a remote API for routing, this one does the routing client-side. This works by loading a pre-built file covering a fixed area and calculating the routes locally.

I'm just getting this repo set up. Docs, an NPM package, and a contribution guide to follow.
